The "Zaculator" was one of the first projects I worked on at my last internship to demonstrate my newly-learned C# and Winform skills.

Make sure to check out "Scientific" or "Programming" mode if you run the program. Other than the UI, the unit conversion extension was never quite finished, so it doesn't work for most units.
